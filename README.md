# Final Year Short Project
**Optimisation of Spacecraft Rendezvous Trajectories Using Multicomplex Derived Sensitivities**

Submitted to obtain the degree of Integrated Master's in Aeronautical Engineering (With a Study Year Abroad)

This was a short project as I spent my third year studying abroad which requires that the final year project be completed within one month to accommodate studying for additional fourth year modules.
